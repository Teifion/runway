### In brief
Runway is a Python Framework built on top of Pyramid. It is designed to handle generic issues such as user logins, theming and suchlike.

### Core functionality and helper systems
* Users and Usergroups
* Error messages and logging
* Hooks
* Command line functionality
* Cron jobs and batch processing
* Plugins
* Usage logging
* Test case setup
* HTML/JS Widgets
* Themes
* Documentation
* Updates to schemas

### Background
Runway was created to handle things in Pyramid I wanted to be handled for me. I love Pyramid's philosophy of making as few choices for you as possible; it just happens these are some choices I'll have the same answer to in most of my work.
